<h3><u>About the Book</u></h3>
<h3><p>
After her mother dies in an accident, sixteen-year-old Bree Matthews wants nothing to do with her family memories or childhood home. A residential program for bright high schoolers at UNC Chapel Hill seems like the perfect escape until Bree witnesses a magical attack her very first night on campus.
<br>
<br>
A flying demon feeding on human energies.
<br>
<br>
A secret society of so called Legendborn students that hunt the creatures down.
<br>
<br>
And a mysterious teenage mage who calls himself a Merlin and who attempts and fails to wipe Brees memory of everything she saw.
<br>
<br>
The mages failure unlocks Brees own unique magic and a buried memory with a hidden connection: the night her mother died, another Merlin was at the hospital. Now that Bree knows theres more to her mothers death than whats on the police report, she will do whatever it takes to find out the truth, even if that means infiltrating the Legendborn as one of their initiates.
<br>
<br>
She recruits Nick, a self exiled Legendborn with his own grudge against the group, and their reluctant partnership pulls them deeper into the societys secrets and closer to each other. But when the Legendborn reveal themselves as the descendants of King Arthurs knights and explain that a magical war is coming, Bree has to decide how far she will go for the truth and whether she should use her magic to take the society down or join the fight.

<h3><u>About the Book</u></h3>
<h3><p>
Alessandra is tired of being overlooked, but she has a plan to gain power:
<br>
<br>
1) Woo the Shadow King.<br>
2) Marry him.<br>
3) Kill him and take his kingdom for herself.
<br>
<br>
No one knows the extent of the freshly crowned Shadow Kings power. Some say he can command the shadows that swirl around him to do his bidding.

<br>
<br>
But Alessandras not the only one trying to kill the king. As attempts on his life are made, she finds herself trying to keep him alive long enough for him to make her his queen all while struggling not to lose her heart. After all, who better for a Shadow King than a cunning, villainous queen?

<h3><u>About the Book</u></h3>
<h3><p>
All sorcerers are evil. Elisabeth has known that as long as she has known anything. Raised as a foundling in one of Austermeers Great Libraries, Elisabeth has grown up among the tools of sorcery magical grimoires that whisper on shelves and rattle beneath iron chains. If provoked, they transform into grotesque monsters of ink and leather. She hopes to become a warden, charged with protecting the kingdom from their power.
<br>
<br>
Then an act of sabotage releases the librarys most dangerous grimoire. Elisabeths desperate intervention implicates her in the crime, and she is torn from her home to face justice in the capital. With no one to turn to but her sworn enemy, the sorcerer Nathaniel Thorn, and his mysterious demonic servant, she finds herself entangled in a centuries old conspiracy. Not only could the Great Libraries go up in flames, but the world along with them.
<br>
<br>
As her alliance with Nathaniel grows stronger, Elisabeth starts to question everything shes been taught about sorcerers, about the libraries she loves, even about herself. For Elisabeth has a power she has never guessed, and a future she could never have imagined.

<h3><u>About the Book</u></h3>
<h3><p>
Of course I want to be like them. They are beautiful as blades forged in some divine fire. They will live forever.
<br>
<br>
And Cardan is even more beautiful than the rest. I hate him more than all the others. I hate him so much that sometimes when I look at him, I can hardly breathe.
<br>
<br>
Jude was seven when her parents were murdered and she and her two sisters were stolen away to live in the treacherous High Court of Faerie. Ten years later, Jude wants nothing more than to belong there, despite her mortality. But many of the fey despise humans. Especially Prince Cardan, the youngest and wickedest son of the High King.

To win a place at the Court, she must defy him and face the consequences.

As Jude becomes more deeply embroiled in palace intrigues and deceptions, she discovers her own capacity for trickery and bloodshed. But as betrayal threatens to drown the Courts of Faerie in violence, Jude will need to risk her life in a dangerous alliance to save her sisters, and Faerie itself.

<h3><u>About the Book</u></h3>
<h3><p>
<i>You must be strong enough to strike and strike and strike again without tiring.</i>
<br>
<br>
The first lesson is to make yourself strong.
<br>
<br>
After the jaw dropping revelation that Oak is the heir to Faerie, Jude must keep her brother safe. To do so, she has bound the wicked king, Cardan, to her, and made herself the power behind the throne. Navigating the constantly shifting political alliances of Faerie would be difficult enough if Cardan were easy to control. But he does everything in his power to humiliate and undermine her even as his fascination with her remains undiminished.
<br>
<br>
When it becomes all too clear that someone close to Jude means to betray her, threatening her own life and the lives of everyone she loves, Jude must uncover the traitor and fight her own complicated feelings for Cardan to maintain control as a mortal in a Faerie world.

<h3><u>About the Book</u></h3>
<h3><p>
<b>He will be destruction of the crown and the ruination of the throne.</b> 
<br>
<br>
Power is much easier to acquire than it is to hold onto. Jude learned this lesson when she released her control over the wicked king, Cardan, in exchange for immeasurable power. 
<br>
<br>
Now as the exiled mortal Queen of Faerie, Jude is powerless and left reeling from Cardan’s betrayal. She bides her time determined to reclaim everything he took from her. Opportunity arrives in the form of her deceptive twin sister, Taryn, whose mortal life is in peril.
<br>
<br>
Jude must risk venturing back into the treacherous Faerie Court, and confront her lingering feelings for Cardan, if she wishes to save her sister. But Elfhame is not as she left it. War is brewing. As Jude slips deep within enemy lines she becomes ensnared in the conflict’s bloody politics. 
<br>
<br>
And, when a dormant yet powerful curse is unleashed, panic spreads throughout the land, forcing her to choose between her ambition and her humanity.
